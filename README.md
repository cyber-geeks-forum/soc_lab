# SOC Lab Management System

A role-based task management and performance tracking system designed for structured departmental operations and training environments.

---

## 📌 Overview

The **SOC Lab Management System** is a PHP + MySQL web application built to simulate structured task delegation and performance monitoring across multiple departments.

The system implements:

* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
* Departmental Isolation
* Many-to-Many Task Assignments
* Proof-of-Work Submission
* Performance Rating
* Skill Documentation
* Activity Logging
* System-wide Administrative Oversight

---

## 👥 User Roles

### 🔹 Super Admin

* Manage users and departments
* View all system-wide tasks
* Monitor cross-department performance
* Access activity logs

### 🔹 Department Admin

* Create tasks
* Assign tasks to multiple members
* Review submitted reports
* Rate completed work
* View department member skills
* Monitor department activity logs

### 🔹 Member

* View assigned tasks
* Upload task completion reports (.pdf)
* Update reports before review
* View ratings
* Document acquired skills
* Update profile credentials

## 🏗 System Architecture

The system uses:

* PHP (Server-side logic)
* PDO (Secure database interaction)
* MySQL (Relational database)
* XAMPP (Local development environment)
* Structured folder organization
* Session-based authentication

---

## 🗄 Database Design

Key relational concepts implemented:

* One-to-Many (Department → Users)
* One-to-Many (Role → Users)
* Many-to-Many (Tasks ↔ Users via task_assignments)
* Foreign Key Constraints
* Cascading Deletes & Controlled Nullification

Core Tables:

* `user`
* `role`
* `department`
* `task`
* `task_assignments`
* `user_skill`
* `activity_log`
